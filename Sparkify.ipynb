    "# Sparkify Capstone Project - Udacity Data Science Nanodegree\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparkify is a streaming service that offers music, similarly to other currently known services such as Spotify. As a user, you can interact with the service and choose your favourite artists, songs, create playlists or add friends. Any time you like, you can give a thumbs up or down. You may decide whether you are happy with the free subscription (and bear the reappearing advertisements) or you are ready to pay for it. You can change your subscription plan any time you want, upgrading or downgrading multiple times. Finally, you can decide to completely quit the app.  But what makes you want to do it?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the question I want to focus on in this article. I want to bring closer to you my approach to and results of a project where I aim at predicting if and why any user would be likely to churn and quit the service provided by Sparkify. \n",
    "Sparkify is a company just like any other, just it is fictitious. Consequently, the dataset consists of simulated logs of user interaction with the service within an observation period. The project itself is a part of the Data Science Nanodegree, organized by Udacity, who provided the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated, the goal is to be able to predict whether a user is about to churn the service and possibly have a deeper insight on what it depends on. Successful prediction would be the first step to keep the customer, as it would prompt an action in form of sending some incentives, analysing discouraging factors, sending personal recommendations and similar. \n",
    "It is advantageous to have customers with paid subscription, however the real problem is to have a customer quit (and not being able to address her/him as a customer anymore), so churning is defined here as quitting the service all together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire development process (data exploration, feature engineering, model selection) is conducted on a subset (1/100) of the full dataset. Model selected after this process can be further trained and tested on the full dataset. Because of its size it cannot be processed locally and has to be processed in the cloud, for example on the EMR cluster (Elastic MapReduce). That is out of scope of this development notebook, yet the logic stays the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of that, the project is realised utilizing advantages of Apache Spark distributed computing framework. In particular, its python API, PySpark and SparkML are used during the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, I divide the strategy for solving the problem into the following steps that I comment on in the next sections:\t \t\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data exploration:\n",
    "    * load the data\n",
    "    * deal with incomplete data, identify outliers \n",
    "    * visualize and understand correlations\n",
    "* Feature engineering:\n",
    "    * transform the data into a dataset of one sample record per user, aggregating features and performing statistics on them\n",
    "    * decide what features to take or what potential new features to engineer\n",
    "    * define the target response variable for training\n",
    "* Modeling and evaluation: \n",
    "     * define objective in mathematical terms\n",
    "     * create proper metric to track performance\n",
    "     * come up with suitable models and train them\n",
    "     * evaluate various models according to the chosen metrics and decide for the most promising one\n",
    "     * refine the model\n"

The former feature means obviously that the user was happy each time giving thumbs up, so gathered positive experience with the service. Importance of added playlists can be understood as a convenience that accumulates over time, of having an own digital music library, that makes the user eager to not try out other services while this one works well. On the other hand, a number of added friends turned out not to be so crucial, apparently friendships are based not only on music or are not so strong.\n",

They are described in the outlook section.\n",

If the user behavior changed over the last 2 weeks, deviating from the user’s average, that could be an indicator of a possible quitting.
